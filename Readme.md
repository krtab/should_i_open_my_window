When trying to control humidity inside a house (and especially reduce it), it can be hard to know whether opening the windows and bringing outside air will help or not.

This programs displays a table estimating, for the given location, how opening the window will influence humidity inside the house.

```
$ ./target/release/should_i_open_my_window 48.864716 2.349014
```

Will display the following table:
